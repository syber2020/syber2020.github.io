<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->

Syed Badruddoja is a doctoral candidate in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://computerscience.engineering.unt.edu/) at the [University of North Texas](https://www.unt.edu/) (UNT). Syed studies blockchain security protocols to secure Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. AI learning algorithms are threatened by poisoning attacks. The data, training algorithms and predictions are vulnerable to such manipulations. Blockchain protects the integrity and availability of data deterring poisoning attacks. Syed investigates the hardness of the blockchain frameworks to secure AI models. The programming inabilities, cost of transactions and latency of predictions are some of the areas he analyses in his research.


Syed worked with Dr. Ram Dantu in the [network security lab](https://nsl.cse.unt.edu/people) and expanded the areas of his research interests. He was inspired to pursue research in interdisciplinary domains involving computer security, artificial intelligence, ambiguous legal contracts and data sharing technologies. His future projects include the investigation of cross-chain communication, data-cooperative privacy models, deliberative consensus for blockchain, and metaverse interoperability. Developing atomic swaps without chain relays and bridges for higher security in cross-chain transactions is one of his envisioned projects. He aims to construct a highly secure cross-chain protocol in a diverse pool of blockchain networks. He plans to continue his research and explore opportunities to collaborate with scholars in the industry and academia.

Syed enjoys teaching undergraduate and graduate-level courses. He served as a teaching assistant for undergraduate and graduate courses for large groups of students and occasionally substituted lecturers in classes at University of North Texas. In addition to grading assignments and conducting summative assessments, he assisted the instructors with the creation of homework, tutorials and projects. Moreover, he developed detailed lab guides in cybersecurity courses to succor students learn through practical implementations. He was also a teaching fellow and taught the operating system course to undergraduate students in the Summer of 2019. The course helped him gain practical experience as an instructor to organize course, manage schedules, guide students and develop teaching skills . He recently completed the [Graduate Student Teaching Excellence Program (GSTEP)](https://clear.unt.edu/programs-initiatives/gstep) offered at UNT and was trained to teach students more effectively to reach their academic and professional goals.

In industry, Syed commissioned computer networks for Wide Area Network (WAN) communication and installed systems for end-to-end communications. He is an expert in routing and switching platform with 6 years of hands-on experience. He installed Cisco [ISR routers](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/routers/1900-series-integrated-services-routers-isr/series.html), [ASR routers](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/asr-1006-router/index.html), [NEXUS switches](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/nexus-7000-series-switches/index.html), [ASA Firewalls](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/asa-5585-x-adaptive-security-appliance/model.html) and [Intrusion Prevention Systems](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ips/7-1/configuration/guide/cli/cliguide71/cli_obtaining_software.html) in large projects involving more than 5000 users . He also led a roll-out team to design, implement, commission and manage [BGP](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_bgp/configuration/xe-16/irg-xe-16-book/configuring-a-basic-bgp-network.html) and [OSPF](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/open-shortest-path-first-ospf/7039-1.html) routing protocols to establish [MPLS VPN](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/net_mgmt/vpn_solutions_center/2-0/mpls/provisioning/guide/PGmpls1.html) connectivity around 36 branches. Additionally he installed [Checkpoint NGFW](https://www.checkpoint.com/quantum/next-generation-firewall/) network firewalls and [Kaspersky](https://usa.kaspersky.com/) endpoint solutions to protect organizations from external and internal threats.

<!-- A data-driven personal website
====== -->
<!-- Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html). -->

<!-- Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right.
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section -->

<!-- Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory). -->

<!-- **Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
